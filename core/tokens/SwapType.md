# SwapType

`SwapType` provides constant string values which denote "Swap Types". "Swap Types" are a method of categorizing 
tokens so as to determiine which other tokens they can be swapped or bridged to.

Please note that this is used internally only, 
and you'll never actually have to use this subpackage for normal or even advanced use of the SDK.
